                <p>I am.. at least I <em>think</em> I am. Maybe I'm not, in any case let me tell you about who I think I am.</p>
                <p>I was born and raised in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, contending with my parents, an older brother and various energetic border collies my family has owned over the past 22 years of life.</p>
                <p>I'm currently finishing up my final year in Acadia University's Computer Science program. I'm back after taking a year off to goof around on co-op getting experience, making contacts and figuring out which aspects I like and dislike about software development.</p>
                <p>My current plan is to start as a dev and either work my way up in another company or eventually start my own company. There is no way in <strong class="hell">hell</strong> I intend to professionally remain a developer when there's kids learning programming in first grade nowadays.</p>
                <p>Recreationally on the other hand, I hope to never stop programming. Working on game projects on the side has been equal parts stressful and fulfilling, but it certainly hasn't stopped being interesting yet. I still have a number of ideas I want to try out some day, and hopefully I'll get to try them all.</p>

                <p>When I'm not working on code of some form or another, I'm usually playing video games, listening to music, reading about various parts of history or hitting the gym. Usually I'm doing at least two of those at any time, I'll leave it up to you to guess which.</p>
                <p>For some quota-filling fun, I'll give you some lists of my favourite things:</p>
